Shlok Sharma's First Wesleyan COMP 333 Project (HTML site): "Quality Notes Music Rating Platform"

Link to site: https://szsharma.github.io

Original template used: "Start Bootstrap â€“ Scrolling Nav"
	link: https://startbootstrap.com/template/scrolling-nav/

The original template was majorly changed, with many of the additional chunks of code taken out (a lot of the custom CSS, JS, and JQuery was ultimately found to not be useful). 

Additionally, there were several content changes, including added sections, added embeds (YouTube videos, primarily), and a major change in the color scheme. 

Also, there is a lot of custom fonts, div styling, id and class attribution styling, and custom colors used in order to maintain a level of consistency and bring the project an added professionalism in the design. 

And obviously the actual copy that was written is all mine (especially the jokes). 

The YouTube videos link directly to their original source, so there shouldn't be any copywright issues. 

The vinyl image is from pixabay.com, so the copywright issue should be avoided there too. 

Thanks!
Shlok Sharma
